It is an Intruder alarm or an anti-theft alarm. So this project is all about building an anti-theft alarm or an intruder alarm using Arduino and PIR sensor. It is possible to enhance this project with many features like adding a GSM module to send SMS alerts to specified mobile numbers when an intruder is detected (when a motion is detected inside the range of PIR sensor).Â  Its working based on the proximity of magnet, so we can measure the magnetic field based on the output voltage and if we can put the sensor and magnetic field based on the output voltage and if we can program it to alarm when the magnetic field is low power and smaller footprint
